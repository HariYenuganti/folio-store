          FOLIO is a tightly edited fashion store: a single place for the
          shirts, dresses, footwear, watches and accessories we&apos;d actually
          wear, from labels we trust.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          We started FOLIO because shopping had become noise: endless tabs,
          thousands of near-identical products, no point of view. Our answer is
          restraint. We choose a small number of pieces, photograph them
          honestly, and tell you exactly what you&apos;re getting: the real
          price, the real reviews, the real stock.
